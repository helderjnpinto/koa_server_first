## vscode debug with nodemon 

Nodemon Setup:
    Use <b>nodemon</b> to relaunch a debug session automatically whenever the JavaScript source has changed.
    Make sure that you have nodemon installed globally. Please note that terminating the debug session
    only terminates the program to debug, not nodemon itself. To terminate nodemon, press Ctrl+C in the
    Integrated Terminal.
